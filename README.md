# Songs Of War
This mod aims to bring a similar experience to what is represented in
the films made by Black Phasma Studios "Songs of War".

At the moment it is very early stage and has a lot of work
to do.

As of now: 
- Extensive gallery of weapons (more in the works)
- A new block: "Weapon Forger": 5x5 crafting forge to craft most of the new weapons

Some future ideas:
- Extensive weapon building
- Bring the "songs" powers to life
- Better Combat mod animation compatibiltiy to maximize the experience
- Custom mobs from the series
- And more as creativity flows and I re-watch the films

All original textures from the films are credit of the kind 
original authors that made public their resources for others to explore their creativity.
